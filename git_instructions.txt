Steps to follow:

1. In the folder where you want to have the repo, open a console.

2. run 'git init' command to start the repository

3. In my case, I have added this txt with the command 'git add git_instructions.txt'

4. I have checked the status of my repository using 'git status'

5. I have published my txt running 'git commit -m "01_git_instructions"
